# OracleProduction
New JPProject Repo
Scenario -OraclProductionOraclProduction Ltd are specialists in producing production line manufacturing plants.They could be asked to create a production plant for any type of product ranging from a simple packaging system to a variety of electronic devices.Recently they have been asked to create a production line for multimedia devices which include music and movie players.  They wish to employee you to design a template in Java for creating and recording all future production line items.  For this particular production facility you will only implement a concrete class for music and movie players.Your task is to create a flexible structure that could be used in any production line.  This structure would then allow easy modification to handle different products.

This project was made as the ongoing/final project in my Object Oriented Programming class at Florida Gulf Coast University. The purpose was to serve as a project that implemented the main things we were learning in the course and to have a well documented, and fully developed program by the end of the course.

## Documentation
